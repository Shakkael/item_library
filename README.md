<h1>ItemLib</h1>

<h2>Hello, I am Shakkael.</h2>
This repo is for my ItemLib script I am making for myself to make it easier to create and store data about items for my RPG sessions.

My goal is to eventually create a script, that will allow to:

[x] Create an item, (which for now is planned to consists of: name, type, tags and modifiers)<br>
[x] Store data about created items<br>
[x] Read data about all created items<br>
[ ] Read data about specific created items, e.g. only items with specific tags or of specific type<br>
[ ] Remove data about chosen item<br>
[ ] Modify data of existing items

Optionally I will also create a GUI for this app.
